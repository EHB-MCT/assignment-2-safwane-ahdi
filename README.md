This project is a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) character creator application with a unique focus on data visualization. Its primary goal is to allow players to create and store their characters while also providing insights into player behavior and preferences during character creation. The tool utilizes various forms of data visualization to analyze and present trends, helping uncover patterns in how players approach creating their ideal characters within the game.

## Features

Select race, subrace, class, subclass, background, alignment, and other traits.
Generate ability scores using methods like Point Buy, Standard Array, or Dice Roll.

### Database Integration:

All character data is stored in a MongoDB database for persistence.
Includes API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing character data.

### Data Visualization:

D3.js is used to visualize character data, such as distributions of classes, races, and alignments.
Dynamic, interactive charts provide insights into the created characters.
